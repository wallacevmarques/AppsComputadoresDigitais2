GAUL Example and Tutorial Code
==============================

The following executables will be generated by the make procedure: 

pingpong	Solves the table-tennis championship problem presented in:
		Dennis E. Shasha, "Dr Ecco's Omniheurist Corner: Foxy",
		Dr Dobb's Journal, 323:148-149 (2001).
		Uses a single 25 integer array chromosome with custom
		mutation and crossover operators.
		This is a perturbation problem.

wildfire*	Solves the fire-fighting problem presented in:
		Dennis E. Shasha, "Dr Ecco's Omniheurist Corner: Wildfires",
		Dr Dobb's Journal, 320:193-194 (2001).
		Uses a single boolean array chromosome.
		Should use a single binary chromosome.
		WARNING: Slow.

goldberg{1,2}	Ports of the examples from Goldberg's book.

dejong		Port of DeJong's GA test suite.

royalroad	Port of Holland's royal road problem.

struggle*	A set of fairly lean examples, showing how little
                application code is needed when using GAUL.
                This program aims to generate the final sentence from
                Chapter 3 of Darwin's "The Origin of Species",
                entitled "Struggle for Existence".
                It uses a character-valued chromosome.
		Several variations of this program are created.

saveload	Demonstration of the population reading/writing functions.
