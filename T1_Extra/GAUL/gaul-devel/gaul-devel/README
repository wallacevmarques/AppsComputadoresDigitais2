Introduction
------------

The Genetic Algorithm Utility Library (or, GAUL for short) is a flexible programming library designed to aid in the development of applications that require the use of genetic algorithms. It provides data structures and functions for handling and manipulation of the data required for a genetic algorithm. Additional stochastic algorithms are provided for comparison to the genetic algorithms. Much of the functionality is also available through a simple S-Lang interface.

GAUL is OSI Certified Open Source Software.

Current features include:

    * Darwinian, Lamarckian or Baldwinian evolutionary schemes.
    * Both steady-state and generation-based GAs included.
    * The island model of evolution is available.
    * Chromosome datatype agnostic. A selection of common chromosome types are built-in.
    * Includes most of the usual crossover, mutation and selection operators.
    * Allows user-defined crossover, mutation, selection, adaptation and replacement operators.
    * Availability of multiple chromosome genomes.
    * Full support for multiple, simultaneously evolved, populations.
    * Choice of high-level or low-level interface functions.
    * Additional, non-GA, optimisation algorithms are built-in for local optimisation or comparative purposes.
    * Trivial to extend using external code via the built-in code hooks.
    * May be driven by, or extended by, powerful S-Lang scripts.
    * Support for multiprocessor calculations.
    * Written using highly portable C code.

The current primary aims for the GAUL development project are to produce documentation, examples and test cases for this open-source release of GAUL. Several new features are also planned for GAUL including wrappers to enable its use with programming languages other than C. The open-source release of GAUL is currently not parallelised, however this will become a priority development target.

The main development platform for GAUL is Linux with the gcc compiler, but in the past GAUL or its non open-source predecessor have compiled successfully on Linux using Compaq's ccc compiler, on Solaris 7 with gcc, on SGI's IRIX 6.5 using the MIPSPro C compiler and on FreeBSD with gcc. It should be fairly trivial to use GAUL on any truly POSIX compliant systems. Full use is made of the GNU maketools to aid portability issues.  A compatibility table is located at http://gaul.souceforge.net/platforms.html
